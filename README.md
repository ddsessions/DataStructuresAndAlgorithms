### *What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?*

&ensp;&ensp; Throughout the Data Structures and Algorithms course, we were assigned two projects. In Project One, I compared the functionality of vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees by writing pseudocode for creating and storing an object in the data structure, reading information from a file, and printing course information. I also created pseudocode for printing a menu and sorting a list alphanumerically with each data structure. Based on this analysis, I offered a recommendation for a data structure to sort course information and prerequisites. In Project Two, I developed code using the hash table data structure that I recommended. In summary, different data structures can be useful for different programming problems, and I had to determine which structure would be the most efficient for our ABCU example.

### *How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.*

&ensp;&ensp; I first determined the basic operations that were going to be performed then how they were going to be executed. From there, I was able to pick a data structure with the best performance trade-off. Itâ€™s important to understand data structures because they allow developers to organize data in a logical order to create efficient programs. This leads to better problem-solving skills and scalable solutions.

### *How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?*

&ensp;&ensp; Studying data structures came with several roadblocks. I had to refer to all of my resources in zyBooks plus multiple YouTube videos and StackOverflow solutions.

### *How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?*

&ensp;&ensp; Before this course, I had not worked with many data structures. I now understand there are different solutions to different problems and choosing the most appropriate structure will allow the program to access data faster and easier. This has also shown me the importance of understanding how the data will be utilized by all users involved.

### *How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?*

&ensp;&ensp; Using data structures makes it easier to create efficient and clear code. Code performance is improved by reducing the time and complexity of algorithms, and if you incorporate a function with a data structure, you can reuse that function in other parts of the program.
